# Drawing and Sculpting with Algorithms

These are the examples for my talk "Drawing and Sculpting with Algorithms". The talk features live coding of examples.

 * Slides TBD
 * Video TBD

## Running the example

 * You need both [npm](https://nodejs.org/) and [git](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+git), then run the following from the command line.
 * `git clone git@github.com:gregtatum/talk-draw-algos.git`
 * `cd talk-draw-algos`
 * `npm install`
 * Next run the commands to start either the beginning example, or the complete one.

## Example 1 - Plane
 * `npm run start-1`
 * `npm run start-1-complete`

 ## Example 2 - Field Function
  * `npm run start-2`
  * `npm run start-2-complete`
